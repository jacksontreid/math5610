### Task 1
Email the link to your repository and table of contents for your completed homework tasks. I understand that this is a very easy task. Make sure that the link is an absolute link. The link should be to the username.github.io repository for the css formatted version.
- Email sent with the link: [jacksontreid.github.io](https://jacksontreid.github.io/)

### Task 2
Implement a method/routine that computes and returns the absolute error in the approximation of a number _x_ by another number _y_. Also create an entry for the method in your software manual.
- Code: [abserr.f90](abserr.f90)
- Software Manual [entry](Software_Manual/abserr.md).

### Task 3
Implement a method/routine that computes and returns the relative error in the approximation of a number _x_ by another number _y_. Also create an entry for the method in your software manual.
- Code: [relerr.f90](relerr.f90)
- Software Manual [entry](Software_Manual/relerr.md).

### Task 4
Implement a method that will add two vectors of the same length. Also create an entry for the method in your software manual.
- Code: [addvec.f90](addvec.f90)
- Software Manual [entry](Software_Manual/addvec.md).

### Task 5
Implement a method that will return a scalar multiple of a given vector. The method should require a vector and number for the operation. Add an entry to your software manual for this method.
- Code: [scalevec.f90](scalevec.f90)
- Software Manual [entry](Software_Manual/scalevec.md).

### Task 6
Implement a method that will compute the 2-norm of an arbitrary vector will real number entries. Add an entry to your for the method you create
- Code: [norm2vec.f90](norm2vec.f90)
- Software Manual [entry](Software_Manual/norm2vec.md).

### Task 7
Implement a method that will compute the 1-norm of an arbitrary vector will real number entries. Add an entry to your for the method you create
- Code: [norm1vec.f90](norm1vec.f90)
- Software Manual [entry](Software_Manual/norm1vec.md).

### Task 8
Implement a method that will compute the âˆž-norm of an arbitrary vector will real number entries. Add an entry to your for the method you create
- Code: [norminfvec.f90](norminfvec.f90)
- Software Manual [entry](Software_Manual/norminfvec.md).

### Task 9
Write a routine that will generate a symmetric matrix that has real values in all entries of the matrix. Add an entry to your for the method you create
- Code: [randsymmat.f90](randsymmat.f90)
- Software Manual [entry](Software_Manual/randsymmat.md).

### Task 10
Search the internet for sites that discuss matrix norms. Look for sites that explain induced matrix norms. Write a brief summary of what you find. Limit the discussion to no more than two or three paragraphs and include links to the sites you cite.
